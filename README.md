============

This app will crash when it first opens. It creates a folder called 'Eos Video Player' in the user directory. Once this has been created please put a .mov or .mp4 file into the folder and the app will work. 

This app worked fine when it was built with MacRuby. With RubyMotion I'm getting huge memory problems. It may be from the way I'm dealing with the scrubbing.
